// make a method that accepts 2 Strings and 1 int (Someones name, age, and favorite color and then returns a story about them)

// Hint1: The objects name is Adlibs and you require a name age and favorite color in a string format and an int format
// Hint2: You will need to return a string. You can concat the int variables and the string variables together
// Hint3: A sample story if you are lost can be as simple as "Hello! My name is ____, and I am ____, and my favorite  
//        color is ___"


public class Adlibs {
    public String story(String name, int age, String favoriteColor) {
        System.out.println("Hello! My name is " + name + ", and I am " + age + ", and my favorite color is " + favoriteColor + ".");
        return null;
    }
